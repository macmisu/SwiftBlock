# SwiftBlock
This is a Safari content blocker for macOS Catalina and later, where Safari no longer supports the normal uBlock Origin extension. This content blocker aims to replicate the essential parts of uBlock Origin in Apple’s custom content blocker format. It’s currently very rudimentary and allows for no customization*.

To use this content blocker:

- Clone this repository
- Open the Xcode project and run it
- Enable the content blocker in Safari

*you can, however, edit the blocklist files in `~/Library/Group Containers/[some code].net.cloudwithlightning.swiftblock/resources`.
